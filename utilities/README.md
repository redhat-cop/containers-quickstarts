# Utilities by Red Hat's Communities of Practice

## What's here?

This directory contains utility images with specific tolling in them. Useful for spinning up those tools on a development machine or using as workers in CI pipelines that do not require any specific CI tooling installed to function as a runtime environment, such as GitLab jobs.

## Published Images

The images are also [published to Quay](https://quay.io/organization/redhat-cop) through the use of [Github Workflows](/.github/workflows).
