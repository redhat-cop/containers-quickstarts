## Overview

OpenShift provides several out of the box Source to Image builder images. To support deployments in Liberty, a new s2i builder image will be created to support a simplified deployment to OpenShift. Once the new image is produced, an example application will be deployed. 

We will use the [extended builds approach](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/dev_guide/builds.html#extended-builds).

With this approach we decouple the build phase and the builder image from the run phase and the runtime image. The builder image is still used to run the builds but the resulting artifact are passed to the runtime image so that it can create a final runnable image. This is all handled by OpneShift with few simple configurations.  

## Bill of Materials

### Environment Specifications

This demo should be run on an installation of OpenShift Enterprise V3.3

### Template Files

None

### Config Files

None

### External Source Code Repositories

* [Example Jee Application](https://github.com/efsavage/hello-world-war) -  Public repository for a simple jee hello world app.

## Setup Instructions

There is no specific requirements necessary for this demonstration. The presenter should have an OpenShift Enterprise 3.3 environment available with access to the public Internet and the OpenShift Command Line Tools installed on their machine.

## Presenter Notes

The following steps are to be used to demonstrate two methods for producing the Source to Image builder image and deploying an application using the resulting image.

### Environment Setup

Using the OpenShift CLI, login to the OpenShift environment.


```
oc login <OpenShift_Master_API_Address>
```

Create a new project called *play-demo*


```
oc new-project liberty-demo
```

### Produce Runtime Image

The Liberty runtime image can be created using the [Git](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/dev_guide/builds.html#source-code) or [Binary](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/latest/dev_guide/builds.html#binary-source) build source

In this example we will use a pre-existing builder image that can build maven based apps: `registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-eap-7/eap70-openshift` 

#### Git Source

The content used to produce the Liberty runtime image can originate from a Git repository. Execute the following command to start a new image build using the git source strategy.:

```
oc new-build websphere-liberty:webProfile7~https://github.com/raffaelespazzoli/containers-quickstarts --context-dir=s2i-liberty --name=liberty-runtime-s2i --strategy=docker
```

Let's break down the command in further detail

* `oc new-build` - OpenShift command to create a new build
* `websphere-liberty:webProfile7` - The location of the base Docker image for which a new ImageStream will be created
* `~` - Specifying that source code will be provided
* `https://github.com/redhat-cop/containers-quickstarts` - URL of the Git repository
* `--context-dir` - Location within the repository containing source code
* `--name=s2i-liberty` - Name for the build and resulting image
* `--strategy=docker` - Name of the OpenShift source strategy that is used to produce the new image

*Note: If the repository was moved to a different location (such as a fork), be sure to reference to correct location.*

A new image called *s2i-liberty* was produced and can be used to build Liberty applications in the subsequent sections.

#### Binary Source

Instead of referencing a git repository, the content can be provided directly to the OpenShift build process using a binary source build. 

The first step is to obtain the source code containing the builder. Once the code has been obtained, navigate to the folder containing the Play Framework *Dockerfile*, and execute the following command to start a new image build using the binary source strategy:

```
oc new-build websphere-liberty:webProfile7 --name=s2i-liberty --strategy=docker --from-dir=. --binary=true
```

Let's break down the command in further detail

* `oc new-build` - OpenShift command to create a new build
* `websphere-liberty:webProfile7` - The location of the base Docker image for which a new ImageStream will be created
* `--from-dir` - Location of source code that will be used as the source for the build process. The contents will be tar'ed up and uploaded to the builder image.
* `--name=s2i-liberty` - Name for the build and resulting image
* `--strategy=docker` - Name of the OpenShift source strategy that is used to produce the new image
* `--binary=true` - Specifies this build will be of a binary source type

A new image called *s2i-liberty* was produced and can be used to build Play Framework applications in the subsequent sections.

### Create the build config

In order to use the extended s2i process we need to configure the build config with some additional pieces of information. There does not appear to be a way to do this directly from the command line so we will use a two-phase approach.

First we will create a standard build config using the git source apporach explained above. Run the follwoing command:
```
oc new-build --docker-image=registry.access.redhat.com/jboss-eap-7/eap70-openshift --code=https://github.com/efsavage/hello-world-war --name=hello-world
```
Second modify the newly created build config to look as follows:
```
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: 'eap70-openshift:latest'
      runtimeImage:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: 'liberty-runtime-s2i:latest'
      runtimeArtifacts:
        - sourcePath: /opt/eap/standalone/deployments/hello-world-war-1.0.0.war
          destinationDir: artifacts
```
notice that the source strategy has two additional sections:
* `runtimeImage`: which defines the runtime image to be used during the build
* `runtimeArtifacts:`: which is an array and specifies a list of artifacts that will be copied from the builder image to the runtime image.

For mode details on how this copy process works, see the [runtime image documentation](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/blob/master/docs/runtime_image.md).

The liberty runtime image expects:
* any deployable artifacts in the $WORKDIR/artifacts directory
* any [Liberty configuration files] (http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSAW57_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.nd.doc/ae/cwlp_config.html) in the $WORKDIR/config directory 

As you can notice the runtimeArtifacts section mentions files by name. This implies that for this process to work the artifact created by the builder image have to be always the same. I expect improvements on this front in future releases of OpenShigt but for now this is a constraint that must be kept in mind.

### Create a new Application

To demonstrate the usage of the newly created builder and runtime images, a Jee example application will be built and deployed to Liberty using the Source to Image process. 

Create the new application by passing in the name of the newly created and configured extended builder image :

```
oc new-app -i hello-world --name=hello-world
```

Let's break down the command in further detail

* `oc new-app` - OpenShift command to create a a new application
* `-i=hello-world` - Name of the ImageStream that contains the result of the build config that uses the extended s2i process
* `--name=play-app` - Name to be applied to the newly created resources

The build that was triggered by the `new-app` command can be found by executing the following command:

```
oc get builds -l=app=play-app
```

View the build logs by executing the following command:

```
oc logs builds/<build_name>
```

*Note: Replace `<build_name>` with the name of the build found in the previous command.*

Once the build completes, the application will be deployed.

## Considerations on http session failover

When liberty is deployed in a cloud environment certain limitation applies as explained in this [document](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.core.doc/ae/cwlp_paas_restrict.html).
With respect to the http session failover, two techniques generally apply:

1. session replication: Liberty does not support session replication out-of-the-box. This feature can be implemented by integrating with eXtremeScale, as described in this [article](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSTVLU_8.6.0/com.ibm.websphere.extremescale.doc/cxshttpsession.html?view=embed).  
2. session persistence: it is possible to persist the session using any database that support a JDBC connection. This [article](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSD28V_8.5.5/com.ibm.websphere.base.doc/ae/tprs_cnfp.html) explains how to configure Liberty to do so.
