## Usage

### OpenShift

Assuming you have the [CLI installed](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/cli_reference/get_started_cli.html)

Build the container and deploy it in OpenShift:

`$ oc run -i -t tool-box-test --image=quay.io/redhat-cop/tool-box --rm bash`

### Docker

Run the container in the background, then shell into. There are important things the container does at boot that you don't want to override. If you need sudo for docker:

`$ sudo docker run -it redhat-cop/tool-box /bin/bash`

If you don't need sudo:

`$ docker run -it redhat-cop/tool-box /bin/bash`

## Building the Image

This image is available publicly at `quay.io/redhat-cop/tool-box`, so there's no need to build it yourself. If you need to build it for development reasons, here's how.

### With Docker

Clone this repo:

`$ git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/containers-quickstarts`

Build the container:

`[containers-quickstarts/tool-box]$ docker build -t tool-box .`

### In OpenShift

`oc new-build https://github.com/redhat-cop/containers-quickstarts --name=tool-box --context-dir=tool-box`
