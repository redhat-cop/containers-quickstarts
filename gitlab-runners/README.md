# Gitlab Runners by Red Hat's Community of Practice

## What's here?

This directory contains Gitlab Runner images that can be easily consumed.

## Quay published Gitlab Runner images

Some of the images kept here are also [published to Quay](https://quay.io/organization/redhat-cop) through the use of [Github Workflows](/.github/workflows).
You can test out our workflows and publish the image to your own Quay organization by forking this repository. You'll also need to enable GH workflows under your fork's settings. Lastly you'll need to update the `quay_org` in the [publish workflow](/.github/workflows/gitlab-runners-ubi8-git-publish.yaml) to point to your own Quay org.
